# Virtual Classroom System

This project is a virtual classroom system designed to understand and implement object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The system allows students and teachers to interact within a virtual classroom environment, enabling functionalities such as user authentication, course enrollment, grading, and more.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in with their username and password. Different types of users (students and teachers) are supported.
- **Registration**: New users can register with the system by providing a username, password, and user type (student or teacher).
- **Student Functionality**: Students can enroll in courses, view available course lists, and display their personal information.
- **Teacher Functionality**: Teachers can add courses, view enrolled students for their courses, assign grades to students, and view assigned grades.
- **Course Management**: Courses are managed within the system, allowing for enrollment and grading.
- **Simple Interface**: The system provides a simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used

- C++: The project is implemented in C++, utilizing its object-oriented features to model users, courses, and interactions within the virtual classroom.
- File Handling: Input/output operations are performed using file handling for tasks such as reading course lists, storing enrollment information, and managing grades.


## Getting Started

To run the Virtual Classroom System on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- Terminal or Command Prompt

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-classroom.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd virtual-classroom
3. To exceute the project:
   ```bash
   bash run.sh
This sequence of commands is typical for compiling and running a C++ project with multiple source files. It compiles each source file separately into object files and then links them together into a single executable.
